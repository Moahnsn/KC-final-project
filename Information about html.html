          <br><h4 class="color">HTML HTML is an abbreviation for hypertext markup languageH, which means hypertext markup language. HTML consists of tags and commands that web designers use to create websites.<br><br>Hypertext is text with links that readers can click to go to another page or part of a page. Meanwhile, a markup language uses tags or plain text with special tags to identify sections of the page, such as headers, footers, and other elements, including tables and images. <br><br>HTML is one of the three basic tools in creating web pages: HTML provides the structure or the way text, images, etc. will appear on a website. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) sets the visual properties of these elements, such as colors, formatting, and layout. Meanwhile, Javascript makes these elements behave in certain ways depending on user action. For example, the font size of text can increase when users scroll the mouse or click a button on the page. <br><br> To write HTML, you'll need a text editor, such as Notepad, Brackets, or Atom. HTML editors make sure that your markup is clean and efficient. They help reduce errors by automatically inserting tags (autocomplete) and other common items or by correcting errors. <br><br></h4>

In 1993 the first version was released, but at that time not many people knew About the language because there are not many developers who are engaged in creating websites. <br><br>In 1995, the second version, HTML 2.0, was issued, which contained some new features. It remained the standard coding language for creating websites until 1997, when Dave Raggett invented the third version, which added new features to the language and provided more features. Power for webmasters to create websites. However, these features slow down the rendering of pages on web browsers. <br><br>In 1999, the fourth version of the language appeared, which proved successful and was widely used. In 2014, the fifth version was released, which is still used by programmers all over the world. <br><br></h4>
