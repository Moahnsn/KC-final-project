          <br><h2 style="color: blue;" class="title">PHP </h2>
                <br><h2 style="color: blue;">What is the language of PHP?</h2>
                <br><h4 class="color">PHP is one of the most important and famous general-purpose scripting languages specialized in developing web applications on the server side, not on the user side, that is, it works behind the scenes to fetch and send data between the browser and the server. It is used to build websites, including content management systems such as: WordPress and Drupal. <br><br>PHP is an open source language developed by Danish programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, and released one year later. A group of volunteer programmers are participating in its development under the PHP license. Most of its codes were taken from the Java, C, and Perl languages and developed over time to become what it is now. <br><br>There are different opinions about why the PHP language was given this name. Some attribute it to the first letters of the phrase Hypertext Preprocessor, which means ‚ÄúHypertext Preprocessor.‚Äù If this name is correct, it is better to say HPP. Others attribute the name to being an abbreviation of the phrase ‚ÄúPersonal Home Page,‚Äù which symbolizes the older version of the language.</h4>
                <br><h2 style="color: blue;">How PHP works</h2>
                <br><h4 class="color">For PHP to work, it needs a server and a browser, in addition to a PHP interpreter, which is responsible for executing the code and collecting its results from the server. When you open a page on a website, the web browser you are using sends a request to the server via a special protocol whose task is to transfer web page browsing requests from the browser to the server, and it is called the Hypertext Protocol (HTTP). <br><br>Then the PHP interpreter processes the request by searching and generating the requested page, whether in HTML or any other format, from the server to send it to the web browser via a special communication channel to appear to the visitor.</h4>
                <br><h2 style="color: blue;">What are the uses of PHP?</h2>
                <br><h4 class="color">Among more than 600 programming languages, PHP has remained on the throne of the most important and most popular programming languages for 25 years. It is used in programming different types of applications, the most prominent of which are: <br><br>1. Website Programming<br><br>The website is divided into two main sections; They are the front end, which is dedicated to everything the user sees and interacts with, including texts, colors, images, and fonts within the site, and relies on custom programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br><br>The other section is the back end. This section is not seen by the user but is dedicated to the server. It is like the site‚Äôs infrastructure, and is responsible for running almost everything such as: databases, servers, the site‚Äôs control panel, and others. PHP is one of the most important languages used in programming it and implementing all its procedures and operations. <br><br>2. Desktop Application Development<br><br>Desktop applications are those applications that are installed on a computer. Although the PHP language is not primarily intended for building desktop applications, in 2012 a programmer was able to develop the ‚Äúphp desktop‚Äù project through which graphical user interface (known as GUI) applications for the desktop can be programmed using the same languages used in Web development such as: PHP, CSS, HTML, and other languages. <br><br>3. Developing content management systems<br><br>PHP is one of the most prominent languages used in developing content management systems (CMS), which are software platforms that enable users to easily create, store, edit, and publish content on the Internet. These systems allow building integrated websites without the need to write programming codes, by providing auxiliary tools such as: templates, plugins, and the like. Examples include WordPress, which is the most famous, and there are other systems as well, such as Drupal and Joomla. <br><br>The content management system in building the website relies on ready-made templates. For example, if you want to build a news website, you can download the appropriate template for you from among the many ready-made templates in the ‚ÄúTemplate Library‚Äù, and then modify the content of the template to suit your activity. <br><br></h4>
