            <br> <h2 class="title">Information about programming</h2>
            <br> <h2 style="color: blue;">What is programming?</h2>
             <br><p><h4 class="color">Programming is the link between a person and an electronic machine. When a person wants to issue commands to these machines, he does not issue them directly. It is not reasonable for me to speak to the computer in Arabic or English and order it to open Rather, the computer is designed according to specific programming steps that command it to work when the start button is pressed. <br> <br>No, if we want to simplify the meaning of programming, it is the codes that a person writes for the machine so that it understands the function required of it. For example, if you want to design a game that deals with cars, you will not need a graphic designer. Rather, you need a software designer who will design this game for you. The same applies to websites and online stores. <br> <br>Do not expect the computer to perform tasks that you have not programmed it to do. To take the example closer, how do you ask your child to swim when you have not trained him to do it before, and the same thing applies to the computer, how do you ask him for a calculator and you have not programmed it and programmed the required command? From it every time the user presses a button. <br> <br>Programming languages are not considered easy, but rather they require a lot of practice and mastery, in addition to that; They are many, varied and developed due to the technical development that we live in today. <br> <br></h4></p>
     <br><h2 style="color: blue;">Programming basics</h2>
     <br><p><h4 class="color">The path to learning the basics of programming begins with programming languages that enable us to communicate with the computer by giving it directions and instructions that it can understand and implement. Programming languages, like human languages, have strict rules that must be followed and adhered to. It is estimated that there are between 500 and 2,000 active general-purpose programming languages according to some statistics, which is a very large number, but the majority of programmers in the world only use a few dozen of them.
      </h4></p><br>
      <p><h4 class="color">One of the best ways to start learning programming from scratch and work your way up as a programmer is to understand the basics of programming. Don't worry if you're not a computer science major. Learning the basics of programming is a bit like the special rules behind any type of strategy game. As long as you understand the rules and logic behind the game, you can play this game and win too even if you're not a professional player. Computer programming doesn't... Very different from this. Programming basics include some basic or simple databases such as array, stack, and queue, and other things such as syntax, data types, loops, variables, and functions. (Functions), and others.</h4></p>
     <br><p><h4 class="color">Take a look at this path, in which the basics of programming are fully explained using the Python language and in Arabic, so you can learn programming from scratch.</h4></p>
     <br> <br><h2 style="color: blue;">The importance of learning programming</h2>
     <ul>
        <br><p><h4 class="color"><li>High demand in the labor market: Programming is one of the skills in demand in the labor market, which brings a respectable income to programmers. In the United States, for example, the average income of programmers is more than $70,000 per year, which is a large amount compared to other fields
        </li></h4></p>
          <br><p> <h4 class="color"><li>Freedom of work: It gives you greater freedom at work. You can work from anywhere you want, from your home, the office, or anywhere in the world. All you need is a computer. Only.</li>
          </h4></p></ol>
          <br><p><h4 class="color"><li>
            Extreme importance: Some programming areas are of great importance in advanced fields, such as artificial intelligence, cryptography, digital currencies, and other promising sectors.
            </li></h4></p>
        <br><p><h4 class="color"><li>Time factor: Learning the basics of programming to become a professional does not require a lot of time compared to other professions. For example, in order to become an engineer, you will need five years of study. On the other hand, it will not require You will only have to learn the basics of programming for a few months, and it will take you only one year or two years at most to delve into programming and master it.</li></h4></p>
        <br><p><h4 class="color"><li>Self-learning: You can begin your journey in learning the basics of programming until you master it on your own. There are thousands of free books, lessons, and educational videos on the Internet.</li></h4>< /p>
        <br><p ><h4 class="color"><li>You do not need an academic degree in order to learn programming. Many professional programmers did not go to university, nor did they obtain any academic degrees, yet they were able to make their way in the world. Programming.</li></h4></p>
        </ul>
        <br><h2 style="color: blue;"></h2><a href="https://blog.edraak.org/%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%87%D9%8A -%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%A9%D8%9F-%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8% A3%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7 %D8%AA%D8%9F/" class="hover2"><h2 style="color: blue;">What are programming trends?</h2></a> </h2>
        <br><p><h4 class="color">After you learned the initial meaning of programming, you must now delve into it. It has many different paths, but if you want to be a distinguished programmer, you must have sufficient experience in all... These paths, even if you specialize in a specific field, and it should be noted that the sub-programming paths increase and develop, but there are basic paths that are the first introduction to programming, which are:</h4></p>
        <br><h4 class="color"><ol><li >
            Website design on the web.
        </li>
        <li>Designing various games.</li>
  <li>Updating basic computer software.</li>
  <li>Update mobile applications.</li>
  </ol></h4>
  <br><h4 class="color">I previously emphasized the necessity of good knowledge of all these paths, and then specialization and depth in a specific field, so I will give a brief explanation of each path.</h4>
  <br><h2 style="color: blue;">How do I learn programming?</h2>
  <br><h4 class="color">We must constantly strive to learn programming and spread it among all levels of society. Our Arab world no longer needs more ignorance. The world today is witnessing terrifying technical development and progress, and we still believe that programming is reserved for a specific category of people. Humans, of course I am not asking all humans to dive into the sea of programming, but it is enough to obtain specific primitive information. It is not normal for someone to mention the Java language in front of you and you think that it is a language spoken by a resident of the Earth, so do not let ignorance get in the way of you, and start learning programming. <br> <br>Learning programming does not depend on academic learning only, but you can learn it from books, YouTube, online educational courses, or in reality, and do not forget that the first way to creativity in this field is perseverance and training.</br> <br>Learning programming does not depend on academic learning only. h4>
